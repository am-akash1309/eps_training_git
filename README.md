# 🚀 Git Training Repository

This repository contains notes and practice exercises from my Git training. The goal of this training was to understand how to use Git for version control, manage branches, resolve merge conflicts, and collaborate on code effectively.

During the training, I learned and practiced the following Git commands:

* `git clone` – Clone a repository into a new directory
* `git init` – Initialize a new Git repository
* `git add` – Add file contents to the staging area
* `git commit` – Record changes to the repository
* `git branch` – List, create, or delete branches
* `git status` – Show the working tree status
* `git push` – Update remote refs along with associated objects
* `git pull` – Fetch from and integrate with another repository or branch
* `git log` – Show commit logs
* `git diff` – Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.
* `git checkout` – Switch branches or restore working tree files
* `git stash` – Stash the changes in a dirty working directory
