Git is used along with Github to link the local folders (in the system) and the global folder (in the Github) to enable multiple users to efectively make changes

To configure git: (Doing it once is enough)
git config --global user.name "am-akash1309"

To config email id:
git config --global user.email "sakashmail@gmail.com"

Cloning repo:
git clone https://github.com/am-akash1309/eps_training_git.git

To list all the directories: Navigate into the folder first, 
    cd eps_training_git
    
    dir/a (Windows)
    ls -a (Linus and Mac)

2 terms: Staged and Unstaged
    - Stages: Similar to putting a letter in the envolpe
    git init
    git add notes.txt

    - Commit:
    git commit -m "fix:message"             //Means we fixed some bugs
    git commit -m "feat:adding index.html"  //Adding additional features
    git commit -m "refactor:message"        //Redoing aparticular file
    git commit -m "docs:message"            //Adding a documentation
    git commit -m "!fix:breaking message"   //Need to be fixed immeditely
    git commit -m "!feat:breaking message"  //Need to be added immeditely
    git commit -m "chore:message"           //Unimportant message

    -Branches: There are nothing but the different folders within the repository

    git remote add origin https://github.com/am-akash1309/eps_training_git.git
    (Adding the origin)

    git branch -M main
    (Renaming the current branch to main. "-M" for renaming)

    git push -u origin main
    (Pushing the unstaged data from origin to main)

    Or just:
    git push

git pull
(The changes in the global repository will be updated into the local repo)

git status
(On branch main it will display the status of the untracked files)
    M = Modifies, but haven't been added to the global repo
    U = The new file haven't been added to the global repo

git diff
(Will display the changes that has been made, in red and green.)
    Red = For the lines that has been removed
    Green = For the lines that has been added
