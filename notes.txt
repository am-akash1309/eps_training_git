Git is used along with Github to link the local folders (in the system) and the global folder (in the Github) to enable multiple users to efectively make changes

To configure git: (Doing it once is enough)
git config --global user.name "am-akash1309"

To config email id:
git config --global user.email "sakashmail@gmail.com"

Cloning repo:
git clone https://github.com/am-akash1309/eps_training_git.git

To list all the directories: Navigate into the folder first, 
    cd eps_training_git
    
    dir/a (Windows)
    ls -a (Linus and Mac)
